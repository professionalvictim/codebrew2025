I can hear the cannons calling
As though across a dream
And I can smell the smoke of hell
In every stitch and seam
And like flowers, the bodies tumble
Around this muddied lot
I cannot hear them scream
"Forget me not"
Your voice it carries over
The hubbub and the hum
And it paints the sky and circles high
Like the beating of a drum
You will scream "I won’t forget you"
But I’ll cover my cold ears
It cannot be a lie
If no-one hears
'Cause although you say good day to me
I know I don’t belong
And although you hold my hand and say
"I love you," you are wrong
Because love does not exist here
In this garden, there’s no feeling
And you say the words so often
That I barely know the meaning
And when all the flowers are rotten
And all the cannons shot
I’ll scream, but you won’t hear
"Forget me not"
And in years to come, you’ll wander
To the place up on our hill
And then you’ll cry to our painted sky
"I loved him then, I love him still"
And you’ll strew some sage and lilies
And roses where I rot
Of all the flowers you picked
I knew you would forget forget-me-nots
